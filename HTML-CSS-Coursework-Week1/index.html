      <p> The village was inhabited by well-known Palestinian families, such as the Nashashibi family. The Palestinian writer Isaaf al-Nashashibi descended from them, whose palace is still there.

Sheikh Jarrah lives more than 3 thousand Palestinians on an area of ​​land estimated at about a thousand dunams, which is the last remaining land for them after the confiscation of thousands of dunams of the residents' lands, on which 3 settlements were established, known as the French Hill settlements.<a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Jarrah" target="_blank"><b>Read Mor Information</b></a></p>

        <h2> Allegations Of Occupation</h2>
        <p> After 3 years of occupying East Jerusalem, the Israeli parliament (Knesset) approved in 1970 a law claiming that Jews had land and real estate in Sheikh Jarrah, and claimed that they owned these land and real estate before the establishment of Israel.
Since then, Israeli governments have succeeded in planting settlement outposts and replacing ultra-Orthodox “Haredi” Jews in the heart of the neighborhood with the settlement of “Shimon Hatsadeq” and the “Shepherd Hotel” settlement that was established in 2011, the headquarters of the occupation police, the Border Guard Command and the Israeli Ministry of Interior, which besieges the Palestinian presence in the neighborhood.</p>
