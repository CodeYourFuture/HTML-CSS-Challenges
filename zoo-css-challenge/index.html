			<h2 class="giraffe-headings">Giraffe</h2>

			<p class="giraffe-larger-paragraph">Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>

			<h3 class="giraffe-headings">Behavior</h3>

			<p class="giraffe-paragraph">Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.</p>

			<p class="giraffe-paragraph">Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.</p>

			<h3 class="giraffe-headings">Height and Size</h3>

			<p class="giraffe-paragraph">Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.</p>

			<h2>Favorite Animal</h2>
			<div class="lion__img">

			</div>
			<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded
			head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The adult male lions have a prominent
			mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184 to 208 cm (72 to 82 in) they are larger than females at 160 to 184 cm
			(63 to 72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related
			females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex
			and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the
			species typically does not.</p>

			<p>Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than
			other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period,
			the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented
			populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red
			List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion
			populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
			habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
