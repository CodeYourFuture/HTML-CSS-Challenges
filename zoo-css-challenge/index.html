			<h2>Giraffe</h2>

			<p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>

			<h3>Behavior</h3>

			<p>Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.</p>

			<p>Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.</p>

			<h3>Height and Size</h3>

			<p>Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.</p>

			<h2>Zabras</h2>
			<p>Zebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. 
				There are three extant species: the Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga) and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). 
				Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. 
				Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. 
				Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, 
				with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies. 
				Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, 
				grasslands, woodlands, shrublands and mountainous areas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. 
				They are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. 
				Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of 
				an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live 
				alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, 
				while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. 
				Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. 
				Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.
