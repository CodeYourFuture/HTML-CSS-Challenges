        <!-- write your html here-->
        <!-- try writing out the requirements first-->
        1. What is the customer's name? I must collect this data, and validate
        it. But what is a valid name? I must decide something. 2. What is the
        customer's email? I must make sure the email is valid. Email addresses
        have a consistent pattern. 3. What colour should this t-shirt be? I must
        give 3 options. How will I make sure they don't pick other colours? 4.
        What size does the customer want? I must give the following 6 options:
        XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL 5. When do they want the t-shirt to be delivered? I
        must collect a date and make sure that date is in the next four weeks.
        How will I do this? How will I make sure there are no mistakes about the
        date?
