    <h2>BIg Cat</h2>
    <p>The term "big cat" is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus Panthera, namely the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the non-pantherine cheetah and cougar.[1][2] Except for the latter three, these species are able to roar.

        Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and some are efficient apex predators.[3] Their native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia; the leopard's range also extends into European Russia.</p>
