    <h2>Working with Sea Turtle Conservation in the Seychelles</h2>
    <h4>Volunteer's Article </h4>
    <p>Cousin island is a sanctuary for all marine lovers. For me, 
        I fell in love with turtle all over again. I grew up in a 
        small coastal town named Darwin, on Australia’s North 
        coast. There my parents established an ecotourism business 
        called Sea Darwin, with the niche being Flatback Turtle tours on a remote island in the Arafura sea. I had been exposed to the nesting behaviours of these Flatbacks for nearly 10 years, and that’s where my interest in sea turtles started. In August 2018, I left tropical Darwin and headed for Europe. There I spent three months before the winter set in. That’s when I decided I needed to defrost, and given my love for sea turtles, I researched turtle conservation in Mauritius. Mauritius because my mother always 
        spoke of it, she had never been but it sounded interesting to her. The Seychelles Island Conservation project was one of the Google results, specifically the program that they had on for the month of November. I read about the Hawksbill Turtle work that they did on Cousin Island and now, I’m meant to be back home in Australia but have found myself returning to Cousin for the next chapter of my adventure.</p>
