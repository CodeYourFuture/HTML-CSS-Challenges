# Zoo Exercise Instructions

You have been hired by a zoo to build a website.

I’ve done the first part but it is full of mistakes. It’s your job to fix them. The client has sent over a list of alterations and recommendations that they want to fix the site with.

## 5) News

Add another news item with the title with today's date, and the title of ‘Which big cat are you?’

## 7) Membership

Give the paragraph a maximum width of 700 pixels, and keep in the middle by adjusting the margin.

When a user hovers over the badge, add a transition so the change in colour is smoother.

## 10) New section

If you have time, add a new section for your favorite animal.
